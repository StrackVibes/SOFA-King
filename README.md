# SOFA King 👑

**SOFA King** is a comprehensive, streamlined solution for managing SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement) permits within military installations. Built with ease-of-use in mind, the system handles everything from permit generation to digital signatures, using the powerful **FARGO HDP5000** card printer and **Microsoft Excel** for database management.
